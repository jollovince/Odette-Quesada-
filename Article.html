      Odette Quesada recalls early career move that empowered her as artist

    <p>
  From <i>Till I Met You</i>, <i>Friend of Mine</i> to <i>Farewell</i> and
  <i>To Love Again</i>, Odette Quesada is responsible for hits that helped define
  Original Pilipino Music (OPM) in the ‘80s. The veteran singer-songwriter’s
  beloved songs have since become ageless after getting revived time and again
  in movies, commercials, and recordings.
</p>

<p>
  “When I was writing the songs, I didn’t have any inkling if anyone would like
  them. All of a sudden they’re recorded, then they become hits at that time and
  I thought, ‘Okay, they would probably have a shelf life of 10 years, then get
  revisited hopefully by the next generation,’” she recently said during a media
  interview with broadsheets.
</p>

<p>
  “But to actually have my songs continuously being played and sung because of
  karaoke, videoke, and YouTube, (the music is) staying alive as well. I can’t be
  any happier knowing that it’s gonna live on.
</p>

<p>
  “They’re my legacy and hopefully, it will be around for another 40 years,” she
  said.
</p>

<p>
  Odette’s music legacy — 40 years as a recording artist and 41 years as a
  composer — will be celebrated via
  <b>Odette Quesada All Hits: The 40th Anniversary Celebration</b> concert on
  Sept. 1 (Friday) at the Newport Performing Arts Theater of the Newport World
  Resorts in Pasay. Among her special guests are Kuh Ledesma, Martin Nievera,
  Regine Velasquez-Alcasid, Raymond Lauchengco, Bituin Escalante, and Arman Ferrer,
  plus Nina Campos as front act.
</p>

<p>
  As a singer, she was discovered by Vicor (now under Viva Communications) boss
  Vic del Rosario after he heard her demos.
</p>

<p>
  “He asked, have you ever thought of singing your own songs? I said no. But I’ve
  heard your demos,” sabi niya, “you could be like a Carole King, writing and
  singing your songs.” Sabi ko, sure, you want me to sing my songs, I’ll sing my
  songs. But wait until I buy a car because mag-popromote ako pero wala akong
  kotse,” Odette shared.
</p>

<p>
  “But he doesn’t even remember talking to me about it (laughs),” she mused. “I
  mentioned it to him when I met with him in L.A. and sabi ko, remember? That’s
  why you had me singing <i>Friend of Mine</i> (first single as a singer)… He has
  the ear for music.”
