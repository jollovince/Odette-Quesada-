      <p>
        <b>Odette Quesada</b> is a legendary Filipina singer-songwriter whose music has defined
        the sound of love and romance in Original Pilipino Music (<b>OPM</b>). From the very
        beginning of her career in the 1980s, she established herself as a
        <b>prolific songwriter</b> with an exceptional gift for weaving heartfelt lyrics into
        <b>timeless melodies</b>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Odette Quesada first gained national attention when she won <b>second prize</b> in the
        <i>1982 Metro Manila Popular Music Festival (Metropop)</i> amateur division for her song
        <i>“Give Me a Chance”</i>, performed by Ric Segreto. In <b>1983</b>, she followed this with
        a <b>monumental achievement</b>—clinching the <b>Grand Prize</b> in the professional category
        at the 6th Metropop for <i>“Till I Met You”</i>, sung by Kuh Ledesma.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <b>1980s became a golden era</b> for the music of Odette Quesada, as her songs were
        brought to life by some of the country’s biggest and brightest stars. The late Ric
        Segreto turned <i>“Don’t Know What to Do, Don’t Know What to Say”</i> into a
        <b>monster hit</b> that remains a classic today.
      </p>

      <p>
        Teen idol Raymond Lauchengco found back-to-back success with <i>“I Need You Back”</i> and
        <i>“Farewell”</i>, while the iconic youth film <i>Bagets</i> was immortalized by its theme
        song <i>“Growing Up”</i>, performed by Gary Valenciano.
      </p>

      <p>
        Her music also left an <b>indelible mark</b> on Philippine cinema. Sharon Cuneta, the
        country’s <b>“Megastar”</b>, recorded <i>“To Love Again”</i> as the theme for her movie
        of the same title.
      </p>

      <p>
        Yet Odette’s artistry did not stop at writing for others. With hits like
        <i>“Friend of Mine,” “You’re My Home,” “Dito Lang,”</i> and
        <i>“Wala Nang Nasa Isip”</i>, she proved that she was also a
        <b>captivating performer</b>.
      </p>

      <p>
        In recognition of her decades of influence, she received the
        <b>Parangal Levi Celerio Lifetime Achievement Award</b> in <b>January 2024</b>, and the
        <b>Ryan Cayabyab Award</b> at the <i>2024 Pinoy Playlist Music Festival</i>.
      <p class="font-semibold pt-4">
        My Favorite Story – A Dedication to Her Audience
        For Odette Quesada, every song is more than just music—it is a
        <b>conversation</b> with those who listen. <i>“My Favorite Story”</i> stands as one of
        her most personal dedications to her audience.
        Through its <b>tender lyrics</b> and <b>timeless melody</b>, she invites listeners to
        remember their own stories of love and life.
        Dedicated to her viewers, the song is a <b>gift</b>—an invitation to reflect, to feel,
        and to treasure the stories that shape who we are.

      <p>
        <b>Odette Quesada</b> is revered as a <b>legendary pillar</b> of Original Pilipino Music
        (<b>OPM</b>), a singer-songwriter whose prolific and emotionally resonant body of work
        has <b>irrevocably defined the sound of love, longing, and romance</b> in the Philippines.
        Her rise through Metropop in the early 1980s established her as a
        <b>major force</b> in the national music scene.
        The <b>1980s</b> marked a golden era for her music, popularized by Ric Segreto,
        Raymond Lauchengco, Gary Valenciano, and Sharon Cuneta.
        Odette later emerged as a recording artist herself, showcasing a
        <b>rare dual mastery</b>—writing timeless songs and interpreting them with sincerity
        and emotional depth.
      </p>
      
      <p>
I don’t think there’s anyone in the world who’s listened to Odette Quesada’s music more than I have. Oftentimes, people say they grew up listening to her music. For me, her music is what I grew up with. Her music was the background to my every childhood memory. I don’t just listen to Odette Quesada, I know her. I know her songs by heart. I know the heartache behind every lyric. I know the joy behind every melody. I know the strength behind every word. I know the woman behind the music.
</p>

<p>
I cannot express how proud of my mom I am for everything she’s done. Growing up, I couldn’t easily share just how electrifying she felt when she got back on stage. It was undeniable. I got the huge reminder that her music wasn’t just something she did before — it was who she was. She is not just Odette Quesada the singer-songwriter. She is Odette Quesada the hardest working mom who moved heaven and earth to make sure I grew up wanting for nothing.
</p>

<p>
For me, my mom is my hero. She taught me how to stand my ground, how to use my voice, and how to love deeply. She taught me resilience, humility, and grace. I am endlessly grateful to be her daughter, and I am honored to witness her legacy. I know that one day, these words will no longer be enough to describe how much she means to me — but at least, I can immortalize my feelings here on print as she always knows how I feel.
