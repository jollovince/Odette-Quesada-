     <p><b>MANILA, Philippines —</b> Singer-songwriter <b>Odette Quesada</b> has penned some of the most heart-wrenching Original Pilipino Music (OPM) hits, including <i>“A Friend of Mine,” “Farewell,” “A Long, Long Time Ago,” “Till I Met You,” “Don’t Know What To Do,” “Love Me Again”</i> (Verni Varga), <i>“Give Me A Chance,”</i> and <i>“To Love Again.”</i> But what many fans don’t know is that Odette also has a witty and humorous side that often surprises those who meet her.</p>

      <p>“When I was at the salon the other day, habang inaayusan ako, sabi nung kasama ko, ‘She’s famous in the Philippines.’ Sabi ko, ‘No, I have some notoriety.’ Then she asked, ‘Are you an actress?’ Sabi ko, ‘I’m a singer.’ She said, ‘Are you married?’ Sabi ko, ‘No, I lost my husband 11 years ago.’ Sabi niya, ‘I’m sorry. Are you ready to love again?’ Sabi ko, ‘You just quoted my lyrics to me,’” Odette recalled with a laugh during an interview at Forbes Park in Makati City.</p>

      <p>Odette was married to fellow singer-songwriter <b>Bodjie Dasig</b>, the lead vocalist of the OPM band <i>Bodjie’s Law of Gravity</i>, who passed away in 2012. Over the years, she commemorated his memory in a special way — by wearing one bracelet every year on the anniversary of his passing.</p>

      <p>“In one of the interviews, napansin nila ang dami kong bracelet. Through the years, dumarami ang bracelets ko. I was marking every year of Bodjie’s being gone with one bracelet. Umabot ako ng eight bracelets. Then I decided I needed to let go — just because he was gone doesn’t mean I need to show it. He’s always in my mind and my heart,” she shared warmly. “Mahirap na baka umabot yung bracelet sa taas,” she added, laughing.</p>

      <p>She also revealed that audiences often expect her to be reserved or solemn because of the emotional nature of her music. “They say, ‘We expected you to be serious, but you’re funny naman pala.’ I have to be, because my songs are sad,” she said. “I have to be a little funny with my spiels.”</p>

      <p>On <b>September 1</b>, Odette will hold her much-awaited concert, <b>“Odette Quesada: All Hits – The 40th Anniversary Celebration,”</b> at the Newport Performing Arts Theater. “These songs are my legacy; hopefully, they’ll be around for another 40 years,” she said. “As a composer, this marks my 41st year — but as a singer, this is my 40th.”</p>
